Our team is Jason and Katerina. 
Jason set up the repository on his github, wrote the random player that works. 
We work together on the heuristics regarding the score and edge positions, with
KAterina writing the initial messy code, Jason rewriting it in a smart way,
and KAterina debugging. 
We both ran test games many many times and amde sure there are no bugs.
Katerina wrote a messy version of minimax that is not really minimax because we
assume the opponent only asssesses the current board state. It wins on average 7 out of 10 games.
